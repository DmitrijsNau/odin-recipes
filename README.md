# odin-recipes

This is going to be my first HTML only project, not sure what the point is
as it doesn't integrate CSS or JavaScript but that's okay. I probably know more
doing just this than when I made the calculator using all 3.

Monday 8/15: added general tso image, fixed link to recipe. Added description, ingredients, and steps to Tsos.
